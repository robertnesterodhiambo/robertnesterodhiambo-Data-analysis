## Quarto

$\mu$

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).



Hide source code:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
1 + 1
```

Hide text output (you can also use `results = FALSE`):

```{r, results='hide'}
print("You will not see the text output.")
```

Hide messages:

```{r, message=FALSE}
message("You will not see the message.")
```

Hide warning messages:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# this will generate a warning but it will be suppressed
1:2 + 1:3
```

Hide plots:

```{r, fig.show='hide'}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the plot will be generated in the above chunk. It is
just not displayed in the output.
