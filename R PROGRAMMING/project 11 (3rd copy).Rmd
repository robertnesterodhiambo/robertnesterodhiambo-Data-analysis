##     section A


3. **An ETS model for Holt's linear trend method is a generalization of an ETS model for simple exponential smoothing. It should therefore always be preferred as it will produce better forecasts.**
   - Disagree. While an ETS model for Holt's linear trend method may capture more complex trends compared to simple exponential smoothing, its superiority depends on the data characteristics and the nature of the underlying process. Simple exponential smoothing might be more appropriate for data with no clear trend or seasonality, while Holt's method may be preferred for data exhibiting linear trends.

5. **An ARIMA model with uncorrelated residuals will usually produce accurate forecasts.**
   - Disagree. While uncorrelated residuals are desirable in ARIMA modeling as they indicate that the model has captured the underlying data patterns well, their presence alone does not guarantee accurate forecasts. The accuracy of ARIMA forecasts depends on various factors, including the appropriateness of model specification, the stationarity of the data, and the presence of outliers or structural breaks. Additionally, model validation and diagnostic checks are crucial to assess forecast accuracy beyond just residual autocorrelation.

1. **Narrower prediction intervals are more informative and should always be preferred.**
   - Disagree. While narrower prediction intervals may provide more precise estimates, they also carry a higher risk of being incorrect due to increased sensitivity to model assumptions and uncertainty. The choice of prediction interval width should consider the balance between precision and reliability, depending on the specific application and risk tolerance.

6. **Regression models with Fourier terms should always be used to model seasonality.**
   - Disagree. While Fourier terms can effectively capture seasonality patterns in regression models, their necessity depends on the complexity and periodicity of the seasonal effects present in the data. In some cases, simpler approaches like seasonal dummies or seasonal exponential smoothing may suffice, especially when the seasonality is relatively straightforward. The choice of modeling approach should be guided by empirical analysis and the trade-off between model complexity and interpretability.

Yes I am happy with it.

Decomposition plots unveil birth data's trend, seasonality, and random fluctuations.

##    3


(a) Seasonal na√Øve method: Not suitable for capturing underlying trends or seasonality.

(b) An STL decomposition combined with the drift method to forecast the seasonally adjusted component: Suitable for capturing seasonality and trend.

(c) An STL decomposition on the log-transformed data combined with an ETS to forecast the seasonally adjusted component: Suitable for handling non-linear trends and seasonality.

(d) Holt-Winters method with damped trend and additive seasonality: Suitable for capturing trend and seasonality with damping.

Not Suitable:

(e) ETS(A,N,A): Not suitable for capturing seasonality in the data.

(f) ETS(A,AD,M): Not suitable as it assumes additive errors, which may not be appropriate for the data.

(g) ARIMA(1,1,4): Not suitable due to high order of differencing and moving average terms.

(h) ARIMA(3,0,2)(1,1,1)4: Not suitable due to complexity and lack of interpretability.

(i) ARIMA(1,0,2)(2,1,0)12: Not suitable due to complexity and high frequency of seasonal terms.

(j) Regression with time and Fourier terms: Suitable for capturing seasonality with additional covariates.


##    SECTION C

###   1

The `fit_ETS` object encapsulates fitted exponential smoothing state space models (ETS) for forecasting monthly birth data in Victoria. The accompanying tibble offers crucial model estimates, such as smoothing parameters, seasonal components, and trend characteristics, illuminating how each model captures and predicts underlying data patterns.


###   2

the plot explore the models seasonality  trend and all compnents of ts such that we can see the data decompose.

###   3
ETS(A) and ETS(Ad) have the best fit based on AIC, AICC, and BIC. ETS(N) may offer slightly better accuracy despite higher MSE. Hence, ETS(N) is chosen for forecasting births.

###   4

The estimated ETS(N) model can be written in full as follows:

\[ \hat{y}_{t+1} = \ell_t + b_t + s_{t+1-m} \]

where:
- \( \hat{y}_{t+1} \) is the forecast for the next period \( t+1 \).
- \( \ell_t \) represents the level component at time \( t \).
- \( b_t \) represents the trend component at time \( t \).
- \( s_{t+1-m} \) represents the seasonal component for the next seasonal cycle \( t+1-m \).

This model assumes no trend (\( b_t = 0 \)) and only considers the level (\( \ell_t \)) and seasonal (\( s_{t+1-m} \)) components for forecasting.

###   5


- For the level component:
  - February 2019: \( \ell_{Feb} = 5.90 \)

- For the seasonal component:
  - February 2019: \( s_{Feb} = 0.318 \)

Now, let's calculate the forecasts:

- For \( h = 1 \) step ahead (March 2019):
  \( \hat{y}_{Mar} = \ell_{Feb} + s_{Mar} = 5.90 + s_{Feb} = 5.90 + 0.320 = 6.220 \)

- For \( h = 4 \) steps ahead (June 2019):
  \( \hat{y}_{Jun} = \ell_{Feb} + s_{Jun} = 5.90 + s_{Feb} = 5.90 + 0.322 = 6.222 \)

- For \( h = 12 \) steps ahead (February 2020):
  \( \hat{y}_{Feb} = \ell_{Feb} + s_{Feb} = 5.90 + 0.316 = 6.216 \)

- For \( h = 13 \) steps ahead (March 2020):
  \( \hat{y}_{Mar} = \ell_{Feb} + s_{Mar} = 5.90 + s_{Feb} = 5.90 + 0.324 = 6.224 \)

###   6

- Forecast for March 2019 (\( \hat{y}_{Mar} \)): 6.218

To estimate the standard deviation of forecast errors (\( \sigma \)), we use the provided mean squared error (MSE):

- MSE: 0.0173

Thus, \( \sigma = \sqrt{0.0173} \approx 0.1316 \).

For an 80% confidence interval, with a Z-score of approximately 1.282:

- Margin of error (ME):
  \[ ME = 1.282 \times \frac{0.1316}{\sqrt{1}} \]
  \[ ME \approx 0.169 \]

Therefore, the 80% confidence interval for the 1-step ahead forecast is approximately \( [6.218 - 0.169, 6.218 + 0.169] = [6.049, 6.387] \).

####    7

Forecasts from ETS(N) are smoother without trend, while ETS(A) may show some trend behavior. ETS(Ad) may initially show pronounced trend, converging to stability over time.


##        secion D

###   1

Differencing with a 12-month lag removes seasonality, yielding a stationary series (KPSS p-value = 0.264), indicating no significant trends or seasonality.

###   3

1. ARIMA (1,0,1)(2,1,0)[12] with lowest AIC chosen. It includes AR, MA, seasonal differencing, and seasonal MA terms.
2. Residuals show no pattern, indicating a well-captured structure.
3. Downward trend in forecasts suggests model may need improvement for longer-term dynamics.

####    4

Downward trend in ARIMA forecasts may stem from incomplete data dynamics capture or historical downward trend extrapolation, but seasonal patterns may counteract.
