# question3 
1. `clear all`: This command clears all existing data and variable definitions from memory. It essentially resets Stata to an empty state, removing any previously loaded datasets and variables. It ensures that the workspace is clean before proceeding with any new analyses.

2. `capture log close`: This command captures any output generated during the current session and writes it to a log file. The `capture` prefix suppresses any error messages that may occur if the log file is already open. The `log close` part of the command closes the log file, finalizing the logging process. Logging output is helpful for documenting analyses and keeping a record of commands and results.

3. `cd`: This command changes the current working directory in Stata. The working directory is the location where Stata looks for files, including datasets and log files. By using the `cd` command, you can specify a new working directory to ensure that Stata accesses files from the correct location.

4. `log using`: This command starts a new log file and directs all subsequent output to that file. It allows you to capture and save the results of your Stata session, including commands and output, for later reference or reporting. The `using` option specifies the name of the log file to create or append to.

5. `import excel`: This command imports data from an Excel spreadsheet into Stata. It allows you to read data from Excel files and convert it into Stata format for analysis. You can specify various options such as sheet names, cell ranges, and variable names to customize the import process according to the structure of your Excel data.

# question 5 (ii)

// Load dataset from Stata format
use "WorldBankData.dta", clear

## question 6

 di "Number of observations: `obs_count'"
Number of observations: 217

## (ii) What is the unique identifier for this data?

Unique identifier: 201821.5831.18922812060.6997.560e+106.1601772

##  (iii) How many variables are there in the data?

Number of variables: 217

## (iv) How many string variables? Are all of these string variables categorical? Discuss.


Number of string variables: 0

# question 7

## (i) To describe the dataset and obtain information about its variables, you can use two main commands in Stata: `describe` and `summarize`. 

   - `describe`: This command provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including the number of observations, the number of variables, variable names, variable types, and variable labels. It also includes the storage type and format of each variable.
   
   - `summarize`: This command provides summary statistics for numeric variables in the dataset, including the number of non-missing observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.

   These commands differ in their output. `describe` provides more detailed information about the dataset as a whole, including variable labels and storage types, while `summarize` focuses on summary statistics for numeric variables only.



## (ii) 
To obtain basic summary statistics for the dataset, you can use the `summarize` command. This command provides summary statistics such as mean, median, minimum, and maximum values for numeric variables. You can specify which variables you want to summarize, or if no variables are specified, it will summarize all numeric variables in the dataset.
