#   *Outlier*

Step 1: Sort the data in ascending order:
40, 40, 40, 45, 45, 45, 50, 50, 50, 55, 55, 60, 60, 65, 65, 70, 70, 85, 90, 120

Step 2: Calculate the first quartile (Q1):
Since we have 20 data points, Q1 is the median of the first half of the sorted data.

Q1 = Median of (40, 40, 40, 45, 45, 45, 50, 50, 50, 55) = 45

Step 3: Calculate the third quartile (Q3):
Similarly, Q3 is the median of the second half of the sorted data.

Q3 = Median of (60, 60, 65, 65, 70, 70, 85, 90, 120) = 70

Step 4: Calculate the interquartile range (IQR):
IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 70 - 45 = 25

Step 5: Determine the lower and upper bounds for outliers:
Lower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
Upper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

Lower bound = 45 - 1.5 * 25 = 45 - 37.5 = 7.5
Upper bound = 70 + 1.5 * 25 = 70 + 37.5 = 107.5

Step 6: Identify any values that fall outside these bounds:
From the sorted data, we see that 120 is the only value greater than the upper bound of 107.5.

Therefore, the outlier in the sample is 120. All other values fall within the bounds and are not considered outliers.
