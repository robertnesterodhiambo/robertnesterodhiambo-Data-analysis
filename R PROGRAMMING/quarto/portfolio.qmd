# Intro to Porfolio Analysis in R

Diversify investment -> porfolio -> increase returnâ€™s expectation and reduce the risk. Hence, we need to test our investment strategy, it is called: backtesting. Backtesting are tested using historical data. We also need to use an online performance monitoring.


```{r}
library(tidyquant)
ko <- getSymbols("ko", from = "2003-01-01", to = "2016-08-30", auto.assign = FALSE)
```
