##     section A


2. The AICC should always be used to select models for forecasting.
   - Disagree: While the Akaike Information Criterion with correction (AICC) is a useful tool for model selection, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. The appropriateness of using AICC depends on various factors such as the sample size, the complexity of the models being compared, and the specific characteristics of the data. Additionally, AICC assumes that the true model is within the candidate set being evaluated, which may not always be the case. Therefore, while AICC can be a valuable criterion for model selection, it should be used in conjunction with other techniques and judgment.

4. The trouble with forecasting is that it assumes the patterns in the past will continue in the future.
   - Agree: This statement highlights a fundamental challenge in forecasting known as the "stationarity assumption." While historical patterns often provide valuable insights into future trends, they can also be disrupted by unforeseen events or changes in underlying processes. Therefore, forecasting should be approached with caution, and analysts should be mindful of the limitations of historical data in predicting future outcomes. Incorporating scenario analysis and sensitivity testing can help mitigate the risks associated with assuming past patterns will continue unchanged.

5. An ARIMA model with uncorrelated residuals will usually produce accurate forecasts.
   - Agree: Uncorrelated residuals are a desirable property in ARIMA modeling as they indicate that the model has adequately captured the autocorrelation structure in the data. When residuals are uncorrelated, it suggests that the model's predictions are not systematically biased, and any remaining patterns in the data have been accounted for. However, while uncorrelated residuals are a necessary condition for accurate forecasts, they are not always a sufficient condition. Other factors such as model specification, data quality, and the presence of outliers should also be considered when assessing forecast accuracy.

6. Regression models with Fourier terms should always be used to model seasonality.
   - Disagree: While regression models with Fourier terms can effectively capture complex seasonal patterns, their necessity depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis. In some cases, simpler methods such as seasonal dummies or seasonal moving averages may suffice, especially when the seasonality is straightforward. The choice of modeling approach should be guided by the complexity of the seasonality, the available data, and the interpretability of the model.


## Section B

###    1
The birth data time series plots from 1980 to 2019 reveal trends, seasons, yearly variations, and monthly fluctuations in birth rates, informing research and policy.


###   2
Yes I am happy with it.

Decomposition plots reveal birth data's trend, seasonality, and remainder, aiding in understanding long-term trends, recurring patterns, and random fluctuations in birth rates.
##    3

(a) Seasonal na√Øve method: Suitable. It's appropriate due to its simplicity and effectiveness in handling seasonal patterns by forecasting future values based on historical observations from the same season.

(b) An STL decomposition combined with the drift method to forecast the seasonally adjusted component: Suitable. This method is fitting because it decomposes the time series into seasonal, trend, and remainder components, allowing for more accurate forecasting by separately modeling the trend with the drift method.

(c) An STL decomposition on the log-transformed data combined with an ETS to forecast the seasonally adjusted component: Suitable. This approach is appropriate as it addresses issues of non-constant variance by log-transforming the data and then utilizes ETS to model the remaining seasonally adjusted component effectively.

(d) Holt-Winters method with damped trend and additive seasonality: Suitable. This method is suitable for capturing both trend and seasonality while also damping the trend to provide more realistic long-term forecasts.

(e) ETS(A,N,A): Suitable. This method is appropriate for forecasting time series with additive error, no trend, and additive seasonality. It's versatile and can adapt to different data patterns.

(f) ETS(A,AD,M): Suitable. This method is fitting for time series data with additive error, additive trend, and multiplicative seasonality, making it suitable for a wide range of time series forecasting scenarios.

(g) ARIMA(1,1,4): Suitable. This ARIMA model is appropriate for capturing the autoregressive and moving average components of the data, providing accurate forecasts for time series with complex patterns.

(h) ARIMA(3,0,2)(1,1,1)4: Suitable. This seasonal ARIMA model is suitable for data with both non-seasonal and seasonal components, incorporating differencing and seasonal terms to produce accurate forecasts.

(i) ARIMA(1,0,2)(2,1,0)12: Suitable. This seasonal ARIMA model is appropriate for capturing both non-seasonal and seasonal components with autoregressive and moving average terms, providing accurate forecasts for seasonal data.

(j) Regression with time and Fourier terms: Suitable. This method is fitting for capturing both trend and seasonality in the data by incorporating time and Fourier terms into the regression model, allowing for accurate forecasting of seasonal time series data.


##    SECTION C

###   1

The "fit_ETS" object encapsulates ETS models fitted to Victoria's monthly birth data, revealing key estimates.

###   2

the plot explore the models seasonality  trend and all compnents of ts such that we can see the data decompose.

###   3

Among the models, ETS(A) and ETS(Ad) have the lowest information criteria, but ETS(N) has slightly lower MSE, making it preferable for forecasting.


###   4

The estimated ETS(N) model can be written in full as follows:

\[ \hat{y}_{t+1} = \ell_t + b_t + s_{t+1-m} \]

where:
- \( \hat{y}_{t+1} \) is the forecast for the next period \( t+1 \).
- \( \ell_t \) represents the level component at time \( t \).
- \( b_t \) represents the trend component at time \( t \).
- \( s_{t+1-m} \) represents the seasonal component for the next seasonal cycle \( t+1-m \).

This model assumes no trend (\( b_t = 0 \)) and only considers the level (\( \ell_t \)) and seasonal (\( s_{t+1-m} \)) components for forecasting.

###   5


- For \( h = 1 \) step ahead (March 2019):
  \( \hat{y}_{Mar} = \ell_{Feb} + s_{Mar} = 5.90 + s_{Feb} = 5.90 + 0.318 = 6.218 \)

- For \( h = 4 \) steps ahead (June 2019):
  \( \hat{y}_{Jun} = \ell_{Feb} + s_{Jun} = 5.90 + s_{Feb} = 5.90 + 0.318 = 6.218 \)

- For \( h = 12 \) steps ahead (February 2020):
  \( \hat{y}_{Feb} = \ell_{Feb} + s_{Feb} = 5.90 + 0.318 = 6.218 \)

- For \( h = 13 \) steps ahead (March 2020):
  \( \hat{y}_{Mar} = \ell_{Feb} + s_{Mar} = 5.90 + s_{Feb} = 5.90 + 0.318 = 6.218 \)

###   6

- Forecast for March 2019 (\( \hat{y}_{Mar} \)): 6.218

W

- MSE: 0.0173 (from the output)

The standard deviation of the forecast errors (\( \sigma \)) is the square root of the MSE:

\[ \sigma = \sqrt{MSE} = \sqrt{0.0173} \]

\[ \sigma \approx 0.1316 \]

Now, to calculate the 80% confidence interval for the 1-step ahead forecast:

- Margin of error (ME) at 80% confidence level:
  \[ ME = Z \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \]
  where \( Z \) is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, and \( n \) is the sample size (which is 1 in this case).

For an 80% confidence level, the Z-score is approximately 1.282.

\[ ME = 1.282 \times \frac{0.1316}{\sqrt{1}} \]
\[ ME \approx 0.169 \]

####    7

Forecasts from ETS(N) differ from other models due to its simpler assumptions, resulting in smoother forecasts. Over time, ETS(N) remains smooth, while ETS(A) may show some trend, and ETS(Ad) converges to stability.


##        secion D

###   1

Differencing the monthly birth data in Victoria with a 12-month lag removes seasonality, rendering the series stationary, supported by a non-significant KPSS p-value of 0.264, indicating no significant trends or seasonality.


###   3

1. The ARIMA model (1,0,1)(2,1,0)[12] is selected based on its lowest AIC value among candidate models. This model includes one autoregressive term, one moving average term, seasonal differencing, and two seasonal moving average terms.

2. The residuals in Figure 9 appear to have no discernible pattern, indicating that the model adequately captures the underlying structure of the data. The residuals seem to fluctuate around zero without any systematic trend or seasonal pattern.

3. While the model selection process and the appearance of residuals suggest a good fit, the downward trend in the forecasts plotted in Figure 10 raises concerns. This trend indicates that the model may not adequately capture longer-term dynamics or structural changes in the data. Therefore, further investigation and potentially a more complex model may be necessary to improve longer-term forecasting accuracy.

####    4

The ARIMA model's downward forecasts may result from insufficiently capturing data dynamics or extrapolating historical trends. Long-term, persistent trends could stabilize or reverse due to seasonal or cyclical patterns, necessitating ongoing model reassessment.
