##     section A


1. **An ARIMA model with uncorrelated residuals will usually produce accurate forecasts.**
   - I partially agree with this statement. While uncorrelated residuals are a desirable property indicating that the model captures most of the data's structure, forecast accuracy depends on various factors beyond just residual correlation. The model's ability to capture underlying patterns, account for trends and seasonality, and adapt to changes in data dynamics are all critical for producing accurate forecasts. Therefore, while uncorrelated residuals are favorable, they do not guarantee forecast accuracy on their own.

2. **Regression models with Fourier terms should always be used to model seasonality.**
   - I disagree with this statement. While regression models with Fourier terms can effectively capture seasonal patterns, their necessity depends on the complexity and characteristics of the data. In some cases, simpler methods like seasonal dummies or seasonal decomposition may suffice, especially for data with clear and consistent seasonal patterns.

3. **The AICC should always be used to select models for forecasting.**
   - I disagree with this statement. While the AICC (Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes) is a valuable tool for model selection, its usage should be contextual. Other criteria such as AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) or BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) may also be appropriate depending on the modeling goals and assumptions.

4. **Regression with time and Fourier terms should always be used to model seasonality.**
   - I partially agree with this statement. Regression models with time and Fourier terms can effectively capture seasonal patterns and long-term trends simultaneously, making them suitable for certain types of data. However, their necessity depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the objectives of the analysis. Simpler models may suffice for data with straightforward seasonal patterns.


## Section B

###    1

The birth data time series plots from 1980 to 2019 unveil insights into birth rate dynamics. The overall plot reveals trends and seasonality, while yearly plots show year-to-year variations. Monthly plots offer detailed intra-year variability, collectively providing valuable insights into birth rate fluctuations for research and policy.

###   2
Yes I am happy with it.

The decomposition plots provide a comprehensive understanding of birth data behavior by showcasing its key components: trend, seasonality, and remainder. Through this analysis, we discern underlying trends, recurring seasonal patterns, and unexplained fluctuations, facilitating a deeper insight into the dynamics of birth rates spanning the past four decades.

###   3

(a) **Suitable:** The seasonal na√Øve method effectively forecasts data with strong seasonal patterns, like birth data, by repeating the previous year's seasonal pattern.

(b) **Suitable:** STL decomposition captures seasonality and trend, enhanced by the drift method's addition of a linear trend.

(c) **Suitable:** STL decomposition on log-transformed data stabilizes variance, ideal for birth data with changing variance, while ETS models the seasonally adjusted component effectively.

(d) **Suitable:** The Holt-Winters method with damped trend and additive seasonality captures trend and seasonality, suitable for birth data with potentially changing trends.

(e) **Suitable:** ETS(A,N,A) suits data with no trend or seasonality, ensuring robust forecasts for stable birth data patterns.

(f) **Suitable:** ETS(A,AD,M) handles data with additive trend and multiplicative seasonality, making it suitable for forecasting birth data.

(g) **Not suitable:** ARIMA(1,1,4) introduces differencing, potentially unnecessary for birth data and leading to overly complex models.

(h) **Not suitable:** ARIMA(3,0,2)(1,1,1)4 is likely too complex for birth data, risking overfitting and challenging interpretation.

(i) **Suitable:** ARIMA(1,0,2)(2,1,0)12 includes seasonal differencing and autoregressive terms, suitable for capturing birth data's seasonality and autocorrelation.

(j) **Suitable:** Regression with time and Fourier terms captures linear trends and seasonal patterns, suitable for birth data forecasting.

##    SECTION C

###   1

The `fit_ETS` object encapsulates exponential smoothing state space models (ETS) tailored for forecasting monthly birth data in Victoria. Its corresponding tibble unveils pivotal model estimates, from smoothing parameters to seasonal features and trend attributes, elucidating how each model grasps and predicts the underlying patterns within the data.

###   2

The plotted graph delves into the intricacies of the model's seasonality, trend, and all components of the time series, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the data's decomposition.

###   3

3. Evaluation of model fit relies on metrics like AIC, AICC, BIC, and MSE, where lower values denote superior fit. ETS(A) and ETS(Ad) exhibit the lowest AIC, AICC, and BIC values, indicating better fit. However, ETS(N) demonstrates marginally lower MSE, implying slightly more accurate forecasts. Thus, for forecasting births over the next two years, ETS(N) is preferred due to its superior accuracy, as indicated by its MSE, alongside comparable AIC, AICC, and BIC values.

###   4

The complete representation of the estimated ETS(N) model is:

\[ \hat{y}_{t+1} = \ell_t + b_t + s_{t+1-m} \]

where:
- \( \hat{y}_{t+1} \) stands for the forecast for the next period \( t+1 \).
- \( \ell_t \) represents the level component at time \( t \).
- \( b_t \) denotes the trend component at time \( t \).
- \( s_{t+1-m} \) symbolizes the seasonal component for the next seasonal cycle \( t+1-m \).

This model assumes no trend (\( b_t = 0 \)) and solely focuses on the level (\( \ell_t \)) and seasonal (\( s_{t+1-m} \)) components for forecasting.

###   5

- For the level component:
  - February 2019: \( \ell_{Feb} = 5.90 \)

- For the seasonal component:
  - February 2019: \( s_{Feb} = 0.318 \)

Calculating the forecasts:

- For \( h = 1 \) step ahead (March 2019):
  \( \hat{y}_{Mar} = \ell_{Feb} + s_{Mar} = 5.90 + s_{Feb} = 5.90 + 0.318 = 6.218 \)

- For \( h = 4 \) steps ahead (June 2019):
  \( \hat{y}_{Jun} = \ell_{Feb} + s_{Jun} = 5.90 + s_{Feb} = 5.90 + 0.318 = 6.218 \)

- For \( h = 12 \) steps ahead (February 2020):
  \( \hat{y}_{Feb} = \ell_{Feb} + s_{Feb} = 5.90 + 0.318 = 6.218 \)

- For \( h = 13 \) steps ahead (March 2020):
  \( \hat{y}_{Mar} = \ell_{Feb} + s_{Mar} = 5.90 + s_{Feb} = 5.90 + 0.318 = 6.218 \)

###   6

- Forecast for March 2019 (\( \hat{y}_{Mar} \)): 6.218

The estimated standard deviation of the forecast errors (\( \sigma \)) can be derived using the mean squared error (MSE) from the model output:

- MSE: 0.0173 (from the output)

The standard deviation of the forecast errors (\( \sigma \)) is the square root of the MSE:

\[ \sigma = \sqrt{MSE} = \sqrt{0.0173} \]

\[ \sigma \approx 0.1316 \]

To calculate the 80% confidence interval for the 1-step ahead forecast:

- Margin of error (ME) at 80% confidence level:
  \[ ME = Z \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \]
  where \( Z \) is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, and \( n \) is the sample size (which is 1 in this case).

For an 80% confidence level, the Z-score is approximately 1.282.

\[ ME = 1.282 \times \frac{0.1316}{\sqrt{1}} \]
\[ ME \approx 0.169 \]

###   7

The forecasts from the ETS(N) model, as depicted in Figure 7, differ from those in Figure 5 due to varying model assumptions. ETS(N) assumes no trend and focuses solely on level and seasonal components, resulting in smoother forecasts. Longer-term forecasts from different ETS models may show more pronounced trend behavior, depending on the inclusion of trend components like damped trends in ETS(Ad).

##     Section D
###   1

Differencing with a 12-month lag is applied to Victoria's monthly birth data to eliminate seasonality, rendering the series stationary (KPSS p-value = 0.264). This stationary series lacks significant trends or seasonality, making it suitable for analysis.

###   3

1. The ARIMA model (1,0,1)(2,1,0)[12] is chosen for its lowest AIC value. Residuals in Figure 9 exhibit no discernible pattern, indicating a good fit. However, the downward trend in Figure 10's forecasts suggests potential shortcomings in capturing long-term dynamics.

2. The downward trend in Figure 10's forecasts may result from inadequately capturing underlying data dynamics or extrapolating historical trends. Long-term forecasts could see stabilization or an upward trend if countered by seasonal or cyclical patterns.

###   4

The ARIMA model's downward forecasts may stem from incomplete data dynamics capture or extrapolating historical trends. Long-term forecasts may stabilize or trend upward if countered by seasonal or cyclical patterns. Regular model reassessment ensures accuracy amid changing data dynamics.
