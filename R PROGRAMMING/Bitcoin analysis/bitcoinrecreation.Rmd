# BITCOIN

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bitcoin, introduced in 2009 by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, stands as the pioneering cryptocurrency.
It operates on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, allowing secure and transparent transactions without the need for a central authority.
Bitcoin's blockchain technology records every transaction in a public ledger, ensuring immutability and trustworthiness through cryptographic hashing.

Our project is structured into two key sections:

**1. Data Exploration** - Analyzing and visualizing Bitcoin price data.
- Identifying trends and patterns in historical price movements.

**2. Time Series Analysis and Forecasting** - **Forecasting Methods:** - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** Leveraging deep learning to capture complex temporal dependencies.
- **XGBoost:** Harnessing gradient boosting to predict Bitcoin price fluctuations.
- **Facebook Prophet:** Using a versatile tool for forecasting with seasonality and holidays.
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** Employing a traditional statistical approach for time series forecasting.

This project draws inspiration from notable kernels and tutorials, including those focused on Prophet, XGBoost, and ARIMA models, tailored specifically for Bitcoin price prediction.

For those new to Bitcoin, you can learn more about its fundamentals [here](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-bitcoin).

# Checking out the dataset in my data folder

From the code below  we set a default data folder we run the code and list the data files in the folder for our case It

-   "bitstampUSD_1-min_data_2012-01-01_to_2018-11-11.csv"

This file has the daily data from 2012 first of January to 2018 eleventh of November hourly market prices for BTC

-   "coinbaseUSD_1-min_data_2014-12-01_to_2018-11-11.csv"

This file has the daily data from 2014 first of January to 2018 eleventh of November hourly market prices for BTC

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Set the directory path where the data is located
data_dir <- "~/Git/Data"

# List files in the directory specified by data_dir
dir_contents <- list.files(data_dir)

# Print the contents of the directory to the console
print(dir_contents)

```



# Environment preparation

## Getting pakages

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Define the list of package names
packages <- c("tidyverse", "plotly", "lubridate", "readr", "dplyr", "zoo", "ggplot2", "forecast", "stats", "tseries")
# Use lapply to load each package
lapply(packages, require, character.only = TRUE)
```

## Data importation

-   **The data importation utilizes the read_csv function from the readr library. our Data has a Timestamp which will be converted to readable form with the code line `mutate(Timestamp = as.POSIXct(Timestamp, origin = "1970-01-01", tz = "UTC"))`**

-   The line interprets the Timestamp in a human-readable form.
    We set the format to UTC and then give it a sample date to use like in our case 1970-01-01.
    and set the path to our file.

-   Here we end the code by displaying the fisrt 6 rows of data.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Define a function to parse timestamps from seconds since the Unix epoch
dateparse <- function(time_in_secs) {
  as_datetime(as.numeric(time_in_secs), origin = "1970-01-01", tz = "UTC")
}

# Expand the tilde to the home directory and specify the file path
file_path <- "~/Git/Data/coinbaseUSD_1-min_data_2014-12-01_to_2018-11-11.csv"

# Read the CSV file into a data frame named 'data'
data <- read_csv("~/Git/Data/coinbaseUSD_1-min_data_2014-12-01_to_2018-11-11.csv")

# Convert the 'Timestamp' column from numeric Unix timestamps to POSIXct date-time objects
data <- data %>%
  mutate(Timestamp = as.POSIXct(Timestamp, origin = "1970-01-01", tz = "UTC"))

# Display the first few rows of the 'data' data frame
#head(data)

```

### Summary statistics

Summary statistics display the minimum and maximum values, explaining the range.
They also include the 1st quartile (Q1), median (Q2), and third quartile (Q3), which elaborate on the interquartile range.
The summary also highlights the total number of missing variables in each column.

```{r}
summary(data)
```

### Comments on Differences:

1.  **Library Usage**:
    -   R uses `dplyr` for data manipulation and `zoo` for forward filling.
    -   Python uses `pandas` for both data manipulation and forward filling.
2.  **NA Replacement**:
    -   In R, `ifelse` within `mutate` is used to replace NA values.
    -   In Python, `fillna` is used directly on the DataFrame columns.
3.  **Forward Filling**:
    -   R uses `zoo::na.locf` to forward fill values.
    -   Python uses `fillna(method='ffill')` for forward filling.
4.  **Timestamp Conversion**:
    -   R uses `as.POSIXct` to convert numeric Unix timestamps.
    -   Python uses `pd.to_datetime` with `unit='s'` and `utc=True` to achieve the same.

### handling missing values

-   From the code below we fill in missing values in the Open High Low and Close columns and replace NAs with the previous value from the one above it.

-   This approach, in the beginning, helps to maintain the continuity of data without losing important rows of the data in other columns.

```{r}
# Fill NA values with zeroes for volume/trade-related fields using dplyr's mutate function
data <- data %>%
  mutate(`Volume_(BTC)` = ifelse(is.na(`Volume_(BTC)`), 0, `Volume_(BTC)`),  # Replace NA with 0 in 'Volume_(BTC)'
         `Volume_(Currency)` = ifelse(is.na(`Volume_(Currency)`), 0, `Volume_(Currency)`),  # Replace NA with 0 in 'Volume_(Currency)'
         Weighted_Price = ifelse(is.na(Weighted_Price), 0, Weighted_Price))  # Replace NA with 0 in 'Weighted_Price'

# Fill forward NA values (last observation carried forward) for OHLC data using zoo's na.locf function
data$Open <- zoo::na.locf(data$Open)    # Fill NA values in 'Open' column
data$High <- zoo::na.locf(data$High)    # Fill NA values in 'High' column
data$Low <- zoo::na.locf(data$Low)      # Fill NA values in 'Low' column
data$Close <- zoo::na.locf(data$Close)  # Fill NA values in 'Close' column

# Convert 'Timestamp' column from numeric Unix timestamps to POSIXct date-time objects in UTC timezone
data <- data %>%
  mutate(Timestamp = as.POSIXct(Timestamp, origin = "1970-01-01", tz = "UTC"))

# Display the first few rows of the updated dataframe 'data'
#head(data)
```



### Getting weekly data

-   The code below groups the data by weeks where we create weekly groupings every 7 days from the date `2015-01-01 00:00:00` to `2018-11-11 00:00:00`. after this, we display the weekly data created and stored as weekly_rows

```{r}
# Create valid date range
start <- ymd_hms("2015-01-01 00:00:00", tz = "UTC")  # Define start date-time in UTC timezone
end <- ymd_hms("2018-11-11 00:00:00", tz = "UTC")    # Define end date-time in UTC timezone

# Find rows between start and end time in 'data' dataframe
filtered_data <- data %>%
  filter(Timestamp >= start & Timestamp <= end)  # Filter data for rows with Timestamp between 'start' and 'end'

# Find the first row of each week (starting on Monday) in filtered_data
weekly_rows <- filtered_data %>%
  mutate(Week = floor_date(Timestamp, unit = "week", week_start = 1)) %>% # Create 'Week' column by flooring Timestamp to the nearest week starting on Monday
  group_by(Week) %>%        # Group rows by 'Week' column
  slice(1) %>%               # Select the first row from each group (week)
  ungroup()                  # Remove grouping for further operations

# Display the first few rows of weekly_rows dataframe
#head(weekly_rows)

```

## Vzualizations

### Lets visualize Historical Bitcoin Market Volume (2015-2018)-Yearly

In the code below we utilise the plotly function from the plotly package to create an interactive plot.
the interactive plot takes in arguments of labels for 1 month 6month and 12 months to make the widgets more interactive.

#### Comparison of the python plot and R plot

![python output](newplot2.png) ![R output](newplot.png)

The Python output doesn't distinguish the open-closed and weighted_price clearly in the plot.
Although ht plots interactively match that of R programming, we see a superiority of the R language in handling the visualizations in a more versatile manner by creating multiple facets for each column while still maintaining the same x and y axis. The plots on the other hand show a rising trend in bitcoin and a drop in 2018 onwards.

```{r}
# Create the traces for each line plot
trace1 <- plot_ly(data = weekly_rows, x = ~Timestamp, y = ~Open, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines', name = 'Open')
trace2 <- plot_ly(data = weekly_rows, x = ~Timestamp, y = ~Close, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines', name = 'Close')
trace3 <- plot_ly(data = weekly_rows, x = ~Timestamp, y = ~Weighted_Price, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines', name = 'Weighted Avg')

# Combine the traces into a subplot with shared axes
fig <- subplot(trace1, trace2, trace3, nrows = 1, shareX = TRUE, shareY = TRUE)

# Update the layout of the plot with title, x-axis options, and range slider
fig1 <- fig %>% layout(
  title = 'Historical Bitcoin Prices (2015-2018) with the Slider',  # Set the title of the plot
  xaxis = list(
    rangeselector = list(

### Lets visualize Historical Bitcoin Prices (2015-2018) - Monthly

This code functions exactly as the previous one, The plot shows a spike in prices every October - December for each year.
This can only be noticed when hovering over the plots and the interactivity becomes active.

# Timeserires Forecasting

**Time Series Forecasting** An experimental set of data that has been seen at various times is called a time series (typically equally spaced, as once a day, once an hour, or once a minute).
A time series would be the daily sales data for airline tickets, for instance.
Dates of significant airline tragedies, for example, are not time series since they are arbitrarily spaced; they are just a collection of occurrences with a time component.
Point processes are a class of random processes.

Time series include seasonality, noise, and trend, among other important characteristics.The technique of predicting the future using data from the past and present is called forecasting.
Here in this kernel, we attempt to perform Time Series Analysis on the Historic Bitcoin Price data.
We can easily see from the **Data Exploration** section, that the Bitcoin prices were quite volatile and inconsistent over the years.
Its very hard to perform Time series analysis on such volatile data.
But here we try to explore the different Time series forecasting models.
All the models used in this Kernel are very basic, there is scope of more complex and better performing models.

-   Time Series forecasting with LSTM
-   Time Series forecasting with XGBoost
-   Time Series forecasting with Facebook Prophet
-   Time Series forecasting with ARIMA

## Prediction using LSTM

The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to capture long-term dependencies and manage the vanishing gradient problem that traditional RNNs often face.
Here's the mathematical formulation of the LSTM model:

### LSTM Components

1.  **Input Gate**:
    -   Input: $x_t$ (input at time step $t$)
    -   Previous hidden state: $h_{t-1}$
    -   Previous cell state: $c_{t-1}$
    -   Activation function: Sigmoid $\sigma$ and hyperbolic tangent $\tanh$
    -   Update: $$
        i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
        $$
2.  **Forget Gate**:
    -   Input: $x_t$, $h_{t-1}$
    -   Activation function: Sigmoid $\sigma$
    -   Update: $$
        f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
        $$
3.  **Cell State**:
    -   Input gate output: $i_t$
    -   Forget gate output: $f_t$
    -   Candidate cell state: $\tilde{c}_t$ (proposed cell state update)
    -   Update: $$
        \tilde{c}_t = \tanh(W_c \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_c)
        $$ $$
        c_t = f_t \cdot c_{t-1} + i_t \cdot \tilde{c}_t
        $$
4.  **Output Gate**:
    -   Input: $x_t$, $h_{t-1}$
    -   Activation function: Sigmoid $\sigma$ and hyperbolic tangent $\tanh$
    -   Update: $$
        o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)
        $$ $$
        h_t = o_t \cdot \tanh(c_t)
        $$

### Parameters

-   $W_i, W_f, W_c, W_o$: Weight matrices for input, forget, cell, and output gates, respectively.
-   $b_i, b_f, b_c, b_o$: Bias vectors for input, forget, cell, and output gates, respectively.
-   $[h_{t-1}, x_t]$: Concatenation of previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ and current input $x_t$.

### Function Explanation

-   **Sigmoid Activation (σ)**: Scales input values between 0 and 1, controlling the flow of information through gates.
-   **Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh)**: Squashes input values between -1 and 1, regulating the cell state update and output.

### Data importaion

This segment is same as the previous codes here now we start omitting the missing values to help in making the analysis more concrete.

```{r, message=FALSE}
data <- read_csv("~/Git/Data/bitstampUSD_1-min_data_2012-01-01_to_2018-11-11.csv")  # Read CSV data into 'data' dataframe
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(Timestamp = as.POSIXct(Timestamp, origin = "1970-01-01", tz = "UTC"))  # Convert 'Timestamp' to POSIXct with UTC timezone

# Define a function to convert Unix timestamp to datetime with UTC timezone
dateparse <- function(time_in_secs) {
  as.POSIXct(time_in_secs, origin = "1970-01-01", tz = "UTC")
}

# Parse the 'Timestamp' column using 'dateparse' function
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(Timestamp = dateparse(Timestamp))

# Group by hour and take the first value in each group
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(Timestamp = floor_date(Timestamp, unit = "hour")) %>%  # Floor 'Timestamp' to the nearest hour
  group_by(Timestamp) %>%  # Group by 'Timestamp'
  slice(1) %>%  # Take the first row from each group
  ungroup() %>%  # Ungroup the data
  select(Timestamp, Weighted_Price)  # Select 'Timestamp' and 'Weighted_Price' columns


data <- data %>% 
  fill(Weighted_Price)  

# Print the first few rows of the dataframe
#head(data)  # Display the first few rows of 'data'
```



**For the train and test, we take '25-Jun-2018' as the split date. There was a considerable dip in Bitcoin prices between the June-July period 2018. If we check the historical prices the seasonal market started going up from this date after reaching the lowest, though the price reached much lower \$5972 on June 29th 2018. After reaching the historic 20K mark on December 18th, there were several dips and market price was recorrected every time.

### Comments on Differences

In R here we used self-made functions and in Python libraries were utilized.
Utilizing libraries in r would have meant creating a virtual python environment to utilize Keras libraries.
This would have meant utilizing the same python code again.

#### XGBOOST MODEL EXPLINATONS

##### IN R

The XGBoost model's output metrics indicate its performance on the training data.

**Training MSE (17614.23)**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) measures the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.
It is more sensitive to large errors due to the squaring operation, providing a higher penalty for larger errors.
An MSE of 17614.23 indicates the average squared prediction error.

**Training MAE (33.55001)**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) calculates the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values, giving equal weight to all errors.
An MAE of 33.55001 signifies the average absolute error in predictions.

Both metrics are essential for evaluating model performance, with MSE being more influenced by larger errors and MAE providing a straightforward average error magnitude.
Lower values for both metrics indicate a better fit of the model to the training data.

#### IN PYTHON COMPARISON

The significant difference in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between the XGBoost models run in R and Python suggests that one of the implementations might have issues or differences in data processing or model setup.
Here’s an analysis to help decide which language might be better based on these metrics:

### Metrics:

-   **R Metrics**:
    -   MSE: 17614.23
    -   MAE: 33.55001
-   **Python Metrics**:
    -   MSE: 484476.69
    -   MAE: 474.81

### Interpretation:

-   **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values. A lower MSE indicates better model performance.
-   **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values. Like MSE, a lower MAE indicates better performance.

### Observations:

-   The model in R has significantly lower MSE and MAE values compared to the Python model.
-   This suggests that the R model is performing much better, predicting closer to the actual values than the Python model.

### Possible Reasons for Differences:

1.  **Data Preprocessing**: There might be differences in how missing values, scaling, or data types are handled in R versus Python.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided metrics, **the R implementation appears to perform significantly better** than the Python implementation.
Therefore, for this specific task and data:

-   **R** would be the better choice given the lower error metrics, indicating a better fit to the data.

# Print model summary and performance metrics
#summary(model_fit)
cat("MAE:", mae_value, "\n")
cat("RMSE:", rmse_value, "\n")

```


#### MAE MSE explainations

The Prophet model's MAE (625.8949) indicates an average prediction error of about 625.89 units, showing how much predictions deviate from actual values on average.
The RMSE (1025.923) highlights a larger deviation, emphasizing that some predictions have significant errors.
Both metrics help assess the model's accuracy.

#### Comparison

The model trained with Prophet in R has an MAE of 625.8949 and an RMSE of 1025.923, while the Prophet model in Python has an MAE of 1678.49 and an MSE of 3654149.48.
Since both MAE and RMSE are significantly lower for the Prophet model, it indicates better prediction accuracy and fewer large errors.
Thus, the Prophet model in R is the better choice for this dataset.

library(ggplot2)
# Filter data_train to start from '2014-12-01' and convert to time series format (ts)
ts_data <- data %>%
  filter(Timestamp >= as.POSIXct("2014-12-01")) %>%

ljung_box <- Box.test(ts_data, lag = 20, type = "Ljung-Box")
print(ljung_box)

```

## PACF

### Interpreting the PACF Plot

1.  **Y-Axis (Partial ACF)**:
    -   The y-axis represents the partial autocorrelation values. These values measure the correlation between the time series and its lagged values, with the effects of intermediate lags removed.
2.  **X-Axis (Lag)**:
    -   The x-axis represents the lag order. Each point on the plot corresponds to the partial autocorrelation at a specific lag.
3.  **Horizontal Blue Lines**:
    -   The horizontal blue lines are the significance bounds, typically set at approximately ±1.96/√N, where N is the number of observations in the time series. Values outside these bounds are considered statistically significant.
4.  **Bars**:
    -   The vertical bars represent the partial autocorrelation values at different lags. If a bar extends beyond the significance bounds, it indicates a significant partial autocorrelation at that lag.

### Key Observations from the Plot

-   **Significant Lags**:
    -   The plot shows that the first lag (very close to 0.014) has a significant positive partial autocorrelation, as indicated by the bar extending beyond the upper significance bound.
    -   Subsequent lags are within the significance bounds, suggesting that they do not have significant partial autocorrelation values.

### Implications

-   The significant partial autocorrelation at the first lag suggests that after differentiation, the time series data has a significant relationship with its immediate past value.
-   This can imply that a simple autoregressive model of order 1 (AR(1)) may be sufficient to model the differentiated series. The differentiation has likely removed any higher-order correlations that were present in the original non-stationary series.
-   If the original series was an integrated series of order 1 (i.e., needed one differentiation to become stationary), this PACF plot of the differentiated series indicates that it is now a stationary AR(1) process.

```{r}
# Differentiate the time series data
diff_ts_data <- diff(ts_data)

# Plot the differentiated time series data
plot(diff_ts_data, main = "Differentiated Time Series")

# PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function) plot of differentiated data
pacf_plot <- pacf(diff_ts_data, lag.max = 5)
plot(pacf_plot, main = "Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) of Differentiated Time Series")


```


## ACF

```{r}
# Differentiate the time series data
diff_ts_data <- diff(ts_data)

# Plot the differentiated time series data
plot(diff_ts_data, main = "Differentiated Time Series")

# ACF (Autocorrelation Function) plot of differentiated data
acf_plot <- acf(diff_ts_data, lag.max = 5)
plot(acf_plot, main = "Autocorrelation Function (ACF) of Differentiated Time Series")
```

## staionerity testt

The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test statistic is -2.8671 with a p-value of 0.2113, indicating insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of non-stationarity in the time series data.

```{r}
library(tseries)

# Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test for stationarity
adf_test <- adf.test(ts_data)
adf_test

```




## ARIMA MODEL

The ARIMA(0,1,0) model for 'ts_data' uses first-order differencing.
It has RMSE of 295.0036 and MAE of 125.1681, indicating moderate predictive accuracy and low residual autocorrelation (ACF1 = -0.0183).

```{r}
# Fit ARIMA model
library(forecast)

arima_model <- auto.arima(ts_data)
#summary(arima_model)
# Forecast future values
forecast_results <- forecast(arima_model, h = 365)  # Forecasting for 365 days into the future

# Extract mean forecast and prediction intervals
forecast_df <- data.frame(date = time(forecast_results$mean),
                          mean = forecast_results$mean)

# Check if lower and upper prediction intervals are available
if ("lower" %in% colnames(forecast_results) && "upper" %in% colnames(forecast_results)) {
  forecast_df <- cbind(forecast_df, lower = forecast_results$lower, upper = forecast_results$upper)
}

autoplot(forecast_results)
#summary(arima_model)
```











## monnthly data

```{r}
# Convert 'Timestamp' to Date format (if it's POSIXct)
data$Timestamp <- as.Date(data$Timestamp)

# Aggregate daily data to monthly averages (or sums if appropriate)
monthly_data <- data %>%
  group_by(year = year(Timestamp), month = month(Timestamp)) %>%
  summarise(Weighted_Price = mean(Weighted_Price)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Create time series object (ts) from monthly aggregated data
ts_data_month <- ts(monthly_data$Weighted_Price, start = c(min(monthly_data$year), min(monthly_data$month)), frequency = 12)

# Print the monthly time series data
#print(ts_data_month)
```

### plot and summary

```{r}
# Example: Plotting the time series
plot(ts_data_month, main = "Monthly Time Series Plot")

# Example: Computing statistics
#summary(ts_data_month)
```

To perform decomposition, ACF, PACF, ADF test, stationarity test, ARIMA modeling, forecasting, and plotting for your monthly time series data `ts_data_month`, here's a structured approach in R:

#### 1. Decomposition

1.  **Observed**:
    -   The top panel shows the original time series data. This is the combination of the trend, seasonal, and random components.
    -   The series starts around 2014 and ends in 2018, with an apparent overall increase over time, particularly a significant spike around 2017.
2.  **Trend**:
    -   The second panel displays the trend component, which represents the long-term progression of the time series.
    -   This component captures the underlying direction in the data. The trend here shows a steady increase, particularly from around 2016 onward, indicating a general upward movement in the data over the observed period.
3.  **Seasonal**:
    -   The third panel shows the seasonal component, capturing the repeating short-term cycle in the data.
    -   This component highlights the periodic fluctuations that repeat over a specific period (e.g., yearly, quarterly). In this series, there is a clear seasonal pattern with peaks and troughs that seem to repeat annually.
4.  **Random (Residual)**:
    -   The bottom panel displays the residual component, which represents the irregular or random fluctuations in the time series that are not explained by the trend or seasonal components.
    -   This component includes noise and any other patterns not captured by the trend or seasonal components. There appears to be a significant spike in the residuals around the same time as the spike in the observed data in 2017, indicating some unusual or unexpected event.

### Interpretation

-   **Trend**: The increasing trend suggests a long-term growth in the observed phenomenon. This could be due to various factors such as economic growth, technological advancements, or other underlying factors driving the increase.
-   **Seasonal**: The repeating pattern indicates a consistent seasonal effect, which could be due to factors such as weather, holidays, or other cyclical events.
-   **Random**: The residuals show the randomness or noise in the data. Significant spikes in this component can indicate outliers or anomalies in the data that may warrant further investigation.

```{r}
# Perform decomposition
decomp <- decompose(ts_data_month)

# Plot decomposition
plot(decomp)
```

#### 2. ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function)

The PACF plot suggests that an autoregressive model of order 1 (AR(1)) might be appropriate for this time series since only the first lag shows a significant partial autocorrelation.
If higher-order lags had shown significant partial autocorrelation, it would suggest considering a higher-order AR model.
In summary, this PACF plot indicates that the time series likely has a significant autocorrelation at lag 1, suggesting the use of an AR(1) model for further analysis.

```{r}
# ACF plot
acf_plot <- acf(ts_data_month, lag.max = 5)
plot(acf_plot, main = "Autocorrelation Function (ACF)")

# PACF plot
pacf_plot <- pacf(ts_data_month, lag.max = 5)
plot(pacf_plot, main = "Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)")
```

#### 3. Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test for Stationarity

```{r}
library(forecast)
library(urca)
library(TSA)
# ADF test
adf_test <- ur.df(ts_data_month, lags = 1, type = "drift")  # Adjust lags as needed
summary(adf_test)
```

#### 4. Stationarity Test

```{r}
# KPSS test (alternative to ADF test)
kpss_test <- kpss.test(ts_data_month)
print(kpss_test)
```

#### 5. ARIMA Modeling

```{r}
# Fit ARIMA model
arima_model <- auto.arima(ts_data_month)
#summary(arima_model)
```

#### 6. Forecasting

```{r}
# Forecast using ARIMA model
forecast_values <- forecast(arima_model, h = 12)  # Forecasting 12 months ahead
#print(forecast_values)

# Plot forecasted values
plot(forecast_values, main = "Forecasted Values")
```
