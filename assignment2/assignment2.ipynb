    "### Task 1: Nearest Neighbor Search\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Models Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequential Scan Based Method**:\n",
    "   - **Concept**: This method involves a straightforward approach where each query point is compared against every point in the dataset to find the nearest neighbor.\n",
    "   - **Operation**: For each query point, calculate the distance to every point in the dataset and identify the point with the minimum distance.\n",
    "   - **Algorithm Efficiency**: Simple to implement but computationally expensive, especially for large datasets, due to its O(n) complexity for each query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Best First (BF) Algorithm with R-Tree**:\n",
    "   - **Concept**: Utilizes an R-Tree data structure to improve efficiency by organizing spatial data for faster spatial queries.\n",
    "   - **Operation**: The R-Tree organizes points into a hierarchy of nodes, where each node's bounding box (MBR) encompasses its child nodes or data points.\n",
    "   - **Algorithm Efficiency**: Reduces the number of distance calculations by only considering points within relevant nodes of the R-Tree. This makes it more efficient than sequential scanning, particularly for high-dimensional and large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **BF with Divide-and-Conquer**:\n",
    "   - **Concept**: Extends the BF algorithm by partitioning the dataset into smaller subspaces (using dimensions like X or Y) and applying the BF algorithm recursively.\n",
    "   - **Operation**: Divides the dataset based on one dimension, constructs an R-Tree for each subspace, and applies the BF algorithm to find the nearest neighbors in each partition.\n",
    "   - **Algorithm Efficiency**: Balances the search complexity by reducing the search space in each recursion step, thereby improving efficiency compared to a single R-Tree approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequential Scan**: \n",
    "  - Suitable for small datasets or initial prototype development due to its simplicity.\n",
    "  - Inefficient for large datasets because it checks every point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BF Algorithm with R-Tree**:\n",
    "  - Efficient for high-dimensional data and large datasets.\n",
    "  - Uses spatial indexing (R-Tree) to prune irrelevant search spaces, reducing computation time significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BF with Divide-and-Conquer**:\n",
    "  - Balances the load by dividing the dataset into manageable subspaces.\n",
    "  - Combines spatial indexing with recursive partitioning, enhancing efficiency for complex spatial queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Skyline Search\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Models Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequential Scan Based Method**:\n",
    "   - **Concept**: Identifies skyline points by sequentially evaluating whether each data point is dominated by any other points in the dataset.\n",
    "   - **Operation**: Compares each data point against all others to determine if it should be included in the skyline (not dominated by any other point).\n",
    "   - **Algorithm Efficiency**: Simple to implement but computationally expensive, especially for large datasets, due to its O(n^2) complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Branch and Bound Skyline (BBS) Algorithm with R-Tree**:\n",
    "   - **Concept**: Utilizes an R-Tree to partition the dataset and efficiently prune dominated points.\n",
    "   - **Operation**: Constructs an R-Tree with MBRs for each data point, then uses a priority queue to iteratively find skyline points.\n",
    "   - **Algorithm Efficiency**: Reduces computational overhead by leveraging spatial indexing (R-Tree) for dominance checking, making it suitable for large-scale skyline queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **BBS with Divide-and-Conquer**:\n",
    "   - **Concept**: Enhances BBS by recursively dividing the dataset and applying the BBS algorithm on each partition.\n",
    "   - **Operation**: Divides the dataset into smaller subspaces (e.g., based on cost or size), constructs R-Trees for each partition, and combines skyline results using dominance screening.\n",
    "   - **Algorithm Efficiency**: Optimizes the skyline search by balancing workload across partitions and leveraging spatial indexing, thus improving overall efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequential Scan**:\n",
    "  - Straightforward but inefficient for large datasets due to quadratic complexity.\n",
    "  - Suitable for small datasets where efficiency is less critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Branch and Bound Skyline (BBS) with R-Tree**:\n",
    "  - Efficiently handles dominance checks using spatial indexing (R-Tree).\n",
    "  - Reduces computational complexity by focusing on relevant data partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BBS with Divide-and-Conquer**:\n",
    "  - Optimizes skyline search by recursively partitioning and combining results.\n",
