1. **Install Postman**: If you haven't already, download and install Postman from the official website (https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

2. **Run the Flask Application**: Make sure your Flask application is running. If it's not already running, you can start it by executing the script you wrote in the terminal or command prompt.

3. **Test the Endpoints**:
   - Open Postman.
   - Use the appropriate HTTP method (POST, GET, etc.) and URL for the endpoint you want to test.
   - If the endpoint requires any parameters or JSON data, specify them in the request body or as query parameters.
   - Click "Send" to make the request.
   - Review the response to see if it matches your expectations.

For example:
- To add a new teacher, send a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/teacher` with JSON data containing the teacher's information.
- To assign a teacher to a classroom, send a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/assign_teacher` with JSON data containing the teacher ID and classroom ID.
- To add a new child, send a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/child` with JSON data containing the child's information.
- To assign a child to a classroom, send a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/assign_child` with JSON data containing the child ID and classroom ID.
