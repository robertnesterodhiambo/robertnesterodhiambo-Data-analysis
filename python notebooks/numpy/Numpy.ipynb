    "This assignment's main objective is for you to learn how to utilize matrix operations, and avoid manual calculations as much as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "This objective will have the following benefits:\n",
    " 1. **Efficiency and Scalability**: Utilizing matrix operations will make your code way more efficient for two reasons:\n",
    " \n",
    "    1.1. **Single Processor Speed-Ups**: Using matrix operations can help your processor plan much better for cache placements, and data fetching. Most numerical computation libraries exploit features of efficient cache usage, SIMD features, etc. This can yield enormous speed-ups using the same computational resources.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.2. **Multi-Processor Speed-Ups**: Matrix operations are extremely parallelizable. This has a significant impact on hardware acceleration; you could have a parallelizable code without even knowing much about parallelization, as most numerical computation libraries try to automatically exploit as much CPU parallelization as appropriate. \n",
    "    \n",
    "       Furthermore, you could easily use GPU acceleration for the same matrix operations if necessary. On the contrary, it is impractical to convert a python code which was built from scratch using python's default data structures for GPU usage.\n",
    "       \n",
    "    1.3. **Spending Less Time Executing High-Level Language Commands and Out-sourcing the Heavy-lifting to Lower-Level Backends**: The high-level languages tend to have expensive commands, as they prioritize coding convinience over efficiency. However, utilizing matrix operations outsources most of the code's heavy-lifting to lower-level languages without the user even knowing about it. For instance, Numpy runs most operations on a pre-compiled C backend. This is also correct about other numerical evaluation libraries such as the automatic-differentiation libraries (e.g., Tensorflow, PyTorch).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    " 2. **Portabiliy**: This will make your code smaller, more understandable, and therefore less prone to have bugs. "
