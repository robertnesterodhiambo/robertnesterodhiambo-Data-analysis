    "\n",
    "This assignment is formed of two parts. In part 1 the goal is to generate a spectrum from first principles given detailed information about the system. In part 2 the goal is to infer information about a system given time-resolved experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to write a report including both parts of the assignment to be submitted via Turnitin. There is a word count limit on the report of 2000 words (with a 10% tolerance), excluding captions, titles and references. Each part of the assignment is worth 50%. The deadline for submission is the 8th of May at 18:00.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of the assignment *is not* to simply complete the task, but to be able to demonstrate your understanding of how the different concepts are related and how the result is obtained."

Although this is a transition from a singlet to a triplet state and therefore forbidden by the spin selection rules, it is a rather intense transition illustrating the importance of spin-orbit coupling in I<sub>2</sub>.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Describe how your spectrum was obtained\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no need to explain the computational tools that you have used, but you should mention the relevant parameters used in your simulation such as to render them reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should outline the relevant theoretical concepts involved in the calculation of the absorption spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analyse the vibronic spectrum and relate it to the dynamics of the system\n",
    "\n",
    "In describing the dynamics you can include a qualitative description of how the wavefunction changes with time and how this relates to the spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also try to be more quantitative in the description of the dynamics, using results that you have obtained (i.e. autocorrelation function) or explicitly calculated in your analysis. You could look for example at how the expectation value of the position changes with times; or how the spread in positions changes in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analyse the virbronic progression\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign the peaks in your spectrum to specific vibronic transitions. In particular, you can try to identify to which excited vibrational eigenstate is involved in the transition with the highest Frank-Condon factor in your spectrum. Consider which auxiliar simulations you could do, and what data you have available, to help you with this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* To make sure you have defined the functions for the potential and transition dipole moment correctly, start by plotting them to reproduce the figures above.\n",
    "* Overlap the plot of your initial wavefunction and the transition dipole moment with your potential curves, to make sure these are defined correctly.\n",
    "* In order to obtain valid results it is critical to set up an adequate grid of space points. The grid should be fine enough to describe high momentum components of the wavefunction. You should set the limits of the grid such that the wavefunction remains equal to zero at the limits of the grid throughout all the simulation to avoid artefacts. Check that this is the case before doing any further calculations.\n",
    "* The time-step should be small enough to propagate the wavefunction correctly. But a too small time-step may require too many steps to be taken, and depending on how fine is your space grid this may need greater memory resources than those available in the computer you are using. Make tests with short runs, and simulate for longer times when needed."

    "A molecular material for low-weight in-door ‘solar’ cells was characterised using absorption, photoluminescence, and transient absorption spectroscopy. The material was a solid mixture of the organic semiconductor ITIC-650 with a modest (<10% by weight) concentration of strong molecular electron acceptor TNF. It is known from literature that ITIC-650 has HOMO-LUMO energy gap of about 2&nbsp;eV. TCNQ has HOMO-LUMO energy gap of ~3.4eV. Undoped ITIC-650 has fluorescence quantum yield close to 30%, however, the prepared ITIC-650:TNF mixture only showed 1% yield of fluorescence. No phosphorescence was observed.\n",

    "The spectroscopic data are provided to you as ASCII files with space-separation between numbers.  Data set includes:\n",

    "Your task is to analyse the experimental dataset and present a report addressing the following questions:\n",
    "1. Identify excited states involved in the photochemistry and spectroscopy of the material. Propose a Jablonski diagram showing key processes happening in the material. When possible, specify the energies of excited states\n",
    "2. Discuss and interpret cross-sections through transient absorption spectrum at (at least) two representative times and two representative wavelengths\n",
    "3. Analyse the dynamics of the excited states and extract the timescale(s) of the dynamics using additional information provided by SVD or global fitting. Relate the identified timescales to the relevant dynamical processes on the Jablonski diagram proposed above.\n",
    "4. Where possible identify the vibrational modes of ITIC-650 and TNF (use multiple approaches if you can). Assign the observed vibrational coherences (if any) to the electronic states.\n",
